# EcommerceSwift

# Overview
In this project two ViewControllers were needed:
- HomeViewController, where the user can add and remove products from the Cart
- CheckoutViewController, where the user can see the final price as well as the discount applied.

The project uses Swift 5, Xcode 14.2, Combine, UIKit, MVVM-C as these are the ones I'm most familliar with. But I enjoy learning and quickly can grasp any tech used by the team.
